# 🎮 Two or Die

A cooperative bomb-defusal puzzle game inspired by **Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes**. Built using the **Godot Engine** and powered by **GDScript**, this game emphasizes communication, coordination, and trust between two players.

## 📌 Overview

In *Two or Die*, two players take on distinct roles:

- 🧨 **Defuser**: The player who can see and interact with the bomb modules.
- 📖 **Instructor**: The player who holds a randomly generated bomb manual and must guide the defuser using only descriptions.

The game is designed to challenge players’ communication skills as they race against the clock to defuse the bomb. It features LAN multiplayer, in-game voice/text chat, dynamic audio, and stylized visuals.
